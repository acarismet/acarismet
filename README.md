<h3>My Path to Software</h3>
<details>
<summary>How I got into software</summary>
<br>
  
:seedling: A self-taught developer who seeks best ways to create. When I worked as a sound technician, learning what was going on behind the scenes of programs that were causing problems and solving them encouraged me to learn behind the scenes. So I embarked on a software path, starting by learning Python. Simultaneously, I completed a course in Mathematics for Data Science at Duke University, based on the fact that programming is not just about language. I learned the language and tools necessary for Front-End Development, a recommended start for self-learners. The basic logic of programming, the basics of coding were complete. Controlling the details from my former professional life and automating the controls in a way that minimizes the human factor was a reflex that was always on my mind while learning software. It was during my industry research that I discovered that Software Testing and Quality Specialization would suit me. Now, on this path that I found by searching step by step, I am moving forward both to be a sought-after name and to create values that I will always remember.
